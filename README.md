# OPTIMIZATION METHODS II

## Objective of the course – aims of the course unit:
The aim of the course is to inform the students about creations and applications of mathematical methods for optimal control of technological and economic processes e.g. in the automation of mechanical systems, in the management of production in mechanical engineering, in project management and in optimization of information systems, using contemporary tools of computer science.

## Knowledge: 
Students will know basic principles and algorithms of methods applicable to the optimization of the:
- deterministic and stochastic
- discrete and continuous
- basic principles and algorithms of methods that are appropriate to creation of decision-support systems for project management, as the tool for the identification, selection and realization of projects.

## Skills: 
Students will be able to apply the above methods to the solution of the practical problems like:
- economic decision
- problems of increasing the reliability of technological devices
- problems of automation control of technological processes
- problems of project management
by using contemporary tools of computer science.
